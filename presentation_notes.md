Presentation Agenda
 presentation time is 5 min.

Intro 1-2min
 ・Self-introduction
   Ernie - construction utilities manager making a change back to full stack web developer

   Atsuyuki -- After many years experience in the telecommunication field, changed career as a web developer.

 ・What we chose as the midterm project
    We chose the wiki maps project and called it simply,  "Map My Wiki" -- where we can map points of interest with brief notes. Any number of maps can be added to the system with any idea the user has. 

 ・How we manage tasks 
   
   We divided tasks into frontend and backend to best align with our time available
   for each section and to make the work flow clean with minimal code conflicts. 

   We were communicating using Trello to create tasks for various components of the project where we needed to keep track of what each other was doing and when it was done - along with notes on how to use newly added features.
   

App flow 2 min
 
 ・Features
  -- single page app - keeping all functions within the loaded page
 
 ・Struggling points
  -- front end struggles were keeping things in sync and reinforcing our learning material of promises, async await and the general asynchronous flow of things.
  -- font end extra struggles:  attempting to build as many modular and re-usable code sections as possible.  It's nice to have "plug and play" code sections for other projects and that is something I try to strive for in each project we build. 

 ・Solutions
  -- solutions to async flow was just to keep track of everything - for me it's just a matter of stopping my work, and visualizing differently where functions need to occur in our asynchronous code

 (・Future development)
  -- a better point management system - it would get more complex with potentially hundreds of points on a map. 
  -- that being said a better point display system - one that displays clusters of points, but then scales in to individual points as you zoom the map

Conclusion 1 min
 ・What we learned though the project is… 
 - (ernie) - a good task management plan makes for efficient work flow, I come from a more chaotic work-flow pattern where a lot of communication is not very clear-cut in who does what, when and how, so working with Atsu via Discord chats and our Trello task board was a nice change. 
 - (Atsu) - A good communication is the most important part in the group project. We divided tasks frontend and backend. That means we are connecting the apis between them. We needed to discuss about what kind of parameters sent by frontend and what kind of values returned from backend. This conversation was a key point of success.
